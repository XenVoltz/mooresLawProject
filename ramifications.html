            <h3>Ramifications, Industry Response and Timeline.</h3>
            
            <p>Because Moore’s law expected growth to be so rapid, there is the problem of
                obsolescence.  Technology is growing so fast that computers, phones and other technology
                become old and outdated very fast.  When smart phones started becoming popular, you
                could keep a phone going strong for a year or two at most before the next phone was
                insanely faster and more efficient.  Now we have so much technology waste that we had
                to find ways to properly dispose of it.  That isn’t completely a bad thing, though, as it created
                many jobs.  I worked at a warehouse for four years that helped repurpose and recycle old
                technology.  So it did create jobs, but we still have a huge amount of waste in landfills thanks
                to how fast technology has grown.  This also has an effect on some businesses that require
                constant uptime of their systems.  As their systems become outdated, these companies are
                sometimes forced to stay on old systems and software because they can’t afford any down
                time due to updates that may break their systems.</p>
