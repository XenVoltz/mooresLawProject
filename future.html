            <h3>A student’s perspective of the future.</h3>

            <p>Just because Moore’s Law is coming to an end in the near future doesn’t mean that our computational
                power won’t increase. We have our developments in Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence to
                thank for that. The future for computer technology is going to keep students and professionals
                busy for years to come. It’s only going to continue to get more and more complex. Unless
                computers eventually take over, of course. Artificial Intelligence sounds like a very complex
                subject, but would be an amazing subject to study. It’s one of the hot subjects right now and with
                enough time and dedication to the subject, I could see myself getting into that field.</p>

                <h3>What does the future look like?</h3>
                <p>Currently, Moore's Law is no longer relevant according to some computer scientists. Moore's law won't be exact througout time, but it is and will be true to some degree. The CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has said that it is dead because it is impossoble. He said Moore's Law would grow 10x every fiver years and 100x every 10 years, but now it is only growing by a few percent every year. It is too difficult and expensive to keep pace with Moore's Law, accordinging to Jensen Huang. Although Moore's Law is considered to be dead, the amount of transistors used will increase. Maybe not at the same rate as Moore's Law says, but it'll still be fast. Technology will continue to advance at a very fast rate.</p>
